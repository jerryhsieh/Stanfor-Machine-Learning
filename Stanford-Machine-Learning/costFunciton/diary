'PS1' is a built-in function from the file libinterp/corefcn/input.cc

 -- Built-in Function: VAL = PS1 ()
 -- Built-in Function: OLD_VAL = PS1 (NEW_VAL)
 -- Built-in Function: PS1 (NEW_VAL, "local")
     Query or set the primary prompt string.  When executing
     interactively, Octave displays the primary prompt when it is ready
     to read a command.

     The default value of the primary prompt string is "octave:\#> ".
     To change it, use a command like

          PS1 ("\\u@\\H> ")

     which will result in the prompt 'boris@kremvax> ' for the user
     'boris' logged in on the host 'kremvax.kgb.su'.  Note that two
     backslashes are required to enter a backslash into a double-quoted
     character string.  *Note Strings::.

     You can also use ANSI escape sequences if your terminal supports
     them.  This can be useful for coloring the prompt.  For example,

          PS1 ("\\[\\033[01;31m\\]\\s:\\#> \\[\\033[0m\\]")

     will give the default Octave prompt a red coloring.

     When called from inside a function with the "local" option, the
     variable is changed locally for the function and any subroutines it
     calls.  The original variable value is restored when exiting the
     function.

     See also: PS2, PS4.
